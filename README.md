# Low-weight-High-speed-Induction-Motor
Design of Low weight High speed Induction Motor using matlab/Octave
The code here is basically the design parameters for low weight high speed Induction motors.
The input specifications or stator and rotor, and output specification for stator and rotor are mentioned in the code
Different parameters such as length,Diameter,Flux density to be maintained, MMF required are calculated using emperical formulas


*******************************************************************************************************************
The speed here in rps = 60 and other parameters considered intitally is for low weight and few for high speed

Also, cost of the design is also taken care intially
